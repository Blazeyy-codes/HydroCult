    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure Authorization Independence, clarity, and scalability. It leverages path-based ownership for user-specific data and avoids `get()` calls in security rules by denormalizing authorization data when necessary. This approach supports atomic operations and simplifies security rule management.\n\n*   `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the user themselves.\n*   `/users/{userId}/dailyGoals/{dailyGoalId}`: Stores daily water intake goals for each user.  Path-based ownership guarantees only the user can access their own goals.\n*   `/users/{userId}/waterLogs/{waterLogId}`: Stores water intake logs for each user. Path-based ownership ensures only the user can access their own logs.\n*   `/users/{userId}/streaks/{streakId}`: Stores hydration streaks for each user. Path-based ownership ensures that only the user can access their own streak data.\n\nThis structure enables straightforward security rules based on `request.auth.uid` and supports efficient querying and listing of user-specific data, thus satisfying the QAPs requirement."
